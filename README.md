"akuma de Purogurama desu kara" stems from Black Butler's Sebastian Michaelis' use of the term "akuma de shitsuji desu kara".

[meaning](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5122/how-can-sebastian-use-i-am-a-butler-and-a-devil-so-casually)

Excerpt:
````
Yeah, it's a pun. When read

悪魔で執事ですから
akuma de shitsuji desu kara
It means

I'm a devil and a butler, you see.
Whereas, when read as the identical-sounding

飽くまで執事ですから
aku made shitsuji desu kara
It means

I'm a butler through and through, you see.
